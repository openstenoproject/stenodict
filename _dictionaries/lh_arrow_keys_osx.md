## Why
Addition to the dictionary of left hand modifier keys for letters and numbers. These are left hand only arrow keys with modifiers.
## How
Strike optionally one of the modifier briefs as explained in the dictionary mentioned, then the stroke TR followed by P (up), W (down), K (left), R (right). Find some more briefs below that only need two strokes.

The system of the modifiers in short:
(`S`=Shift, `KPWR`=Cmd, `A`=Alt, `H`=Control)

###**Examples:**
- `TR/K` left
- `SKPWRA/TR/W` Shift+Command+Alt+down

###Additional briefs for cursor movement
- `TPHR/P` Page Up
- `TPHR/W` Page Down
- `TPHR/K` Home
- `TPHR/R` End

- `TKPWR/P(W,K,R)` Alt+Up(Down, Left, Right)
- `TRO/P(W,K,R)` Command+Up(Down, Left, Right)
- `TKPWRO/P(W,K,R)` Command+Alt+Up(Down, Left, Right)
